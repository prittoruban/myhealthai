# MyHealthAI - Complete Prototype Summary

## üéØ Overview
**MyHealthAI** is a full-stack web application designed to help Indian users track their edible oil consumption, promoting healthier cooking habits through AI-powered insights and gamification.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture
The application strictly adheres to modern system design principles with **clear separation of concerns** across three layers:

### 1. **Data Layer** (`/lib` & `/models`)
- **MongoDB Connection** (`lib/mongodb.ts`): Cached connection for serverless
- **User Model** (`models/user.model.ts`): Authentication, gamification (points), daily goals
- **ConsumptionLog Model** (`models/log.model.ts`): Meal logging with timestamps

### 2. **Application Layer** (`/src/app/api`)
- **Authentication** (`/api/auth`): NextAuth.js with Credentials provider
- **User Registration** (`/api/auth/register`): Secure password hashing with bcryptjs
- **Logs API** (`/api/logs`): CRUD operations for meal tracking
- **Weekly Logs API** (`/api/logs/weekly`): 7-day consumption history
- **Recipe API** (`/api/rasoiai/recipe`): Low-oil Indian recipes
- **User Profile API** (`/api/user`): User data retrieval
- **Demo Seeding** (`/api/seed-demo`): Pre-populated demo account

### 3. **Presentation Layer** (`/src/app` & `/components`)
#### Pages:
- **Landing Page** (`/`): Modern hero section, features grid, stats, CTA
